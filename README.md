This is the code for a 2D UV printing setup. 

The setup includes 2 KDC101 stages, and 1 UV light source. 
The input image should be prepared with pixels, then the multiplier with unit um should be set from gui to transfer the curing spot locations to real dimensions. 
Input image is set so the prints with different dimensions can be simply realized using different apertures with same design.
